# Prework Study Guide Webpage


## Description

This is a study guide for my pre work for the Uconn coding bootcamp. Its a organized and structured way to keep my notes and refer back to them when I need to. It also helps with learning the gitflow when having to update it when adding new notes. It's a study guide that can be accesed from any device and building it helped me with the building blocks of HTML, CSS, GIT and JavaScript
